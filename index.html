        <h2> My first time coding from scratch! </h2>
        <h3>Hello, visitor and welcome to my website! I am Calix Clark, the maker of this, and as stated above, this is my first ever and completely from scratch website! I was able to code this site through Neumont College of Computer Science's 2019 Summer Scholars program.
             This program was used to teach highschoolers the basics of html in 5 weeks. This course was taught by my father, Timothy Clark, who is currently the VP of acedemic operations at Neumont.</h3>
