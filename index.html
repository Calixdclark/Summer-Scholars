        <h2> My first time coding from scratch! </h2>
        <h3>Hello, visitor and welcome to my website! I am Calix Clark, the maker of this, and as stated above, this is my first ever and completely from scratch website! I was able to code this site through Neumont College of Computer Science's 2019 Summer Scholars program.
             This program was used to teach highschoolers the basics of html in 5 weeks. This course was taught by my father, Timothy Clark, who is currently the VP of acedemic operations at Neumont.Neumont College of Computer Science is a for profit technical college based in Salt Lake City, Utah. They take in students from all over the US and not just Utah. Many of the graduated students have gotten jobs at large tech companies like Amazon and Google. They offer degrees in BSCS (BACHELOR OF SCIENCE
                IN COMPUTER SCIENCE), BSGD (BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN SOFTWARE AND GAME DEVELOPMENT), BSIS (BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS), BSTM (BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT), BSWD (BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN WEB DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT) and BSSE (BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING).

                    <h3> Hi, I am Calix Clark, the creator of this site! I am a 16 year old, male teenager and am a HUGE nerd. I enjoy almost anything Marvel, as long as it is phases 1-3, amongst other sci fi movies. (click <a href="favorites.html">here</a> for a list of my interests and favorite sites).
                         My family has never lived in one place for more than a year, with a few exceptions. One of these, is when I lived in Grantsville Utah for 4 years, but I will get to that later. One of these short lived but exciting moves was when we live in Malaysia for about one year.
                         My father, Timothy Clark, who is currently the VP of Acedemic Operations at Neumont College of Computer Sciences was offered to my dad, which he quickly accepted after discussing it with the rest of our family.
                         After a few months of prepping and packing, we moved to Malaysia, where we got our first taste of foreign food and culture. The adventure we had experienced, which was mentioned before, was when my family lived in Grantsville. It was not only one of the first time we lived somewhere for more than a year, it was also our first time running a microfarm.
                         It was an awesome experience where we had worked harder than ever before, but we also learned how to care for various types of animals, such as goats, chickens, turkeys, rabbits and ducks. And after extensive research, we also had to assemble shelters for them in our weed filled, one acre backward, as well as buy supplies such as food, troughs for the animals to eat and drink out of.
                         We also got and heat lamps, special vitamin water for the foul and large tubs for the chicks to live in until they matured. It was amazing learning where our food came from, and how to raise and cull animals for food.</h3>
