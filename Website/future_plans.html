            My Plans for the Future
        </h1>
        <p class="fp-text">
        I have a few plans regarding my future, and I believe that I can achieve these goal. As a highschooler who is on track to graduate one year early, I imagine many employers will find that impressive and wish to hire me based purely on that fact.
         As well as the fact that I plan to graduate with a 4.0 or close to that. Another factor that will play a prominent role in my future is that I am part of the NHS or National Honors Society and should be graduating with honors. With all of these factors,
         I feel that I could easily get any job I wish, so long as I have the proper education. Me being a very detail oriented person I would most likely seek out a job in digital arts, such as 3d modeling. I have no particular company I wish to work for, but I hope to be noticed by larger film companies such as Sony Entertainment. As for education, I would like to go to Neumont to learn coding,
         and Full Sail University in Florida for my digital arts education. (For more information about Full Sail University, click <a href="https://www.fullsail.edu/" target="blank"><em>Here</em></a>)
