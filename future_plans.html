        <h2>Plans for the Future</h2>
        <h3>
        I have a few plans regarding my future, and I believe that I can achieve these goal. As a highschooler who is on track to graduate one year early, I imagine many employers will find that impressive and wish to hire me based purely on that fact.
         As well as the fact that I plan to graduate with a 4.0 or close to that. Another factor that will play a prominent role in my future is that I am part of the NHS or National Honors Society and should be graduating with honors. With all of these factors,
         I feel that I could easily get any job I wish, so long as I have the proper education.

         Me being a very detail oriented person I would most likely seek out a job in the tech field, digital arts
